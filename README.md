# RobloxCheats
Cheating tool for Roblox (macOS M1)

## Notes
 - <b>libESP.dylib</b> controls all in-app inputs and UI
 - <b>_RobloxCheats</b> is the actual executable to run after libESP.dylib is injected into Roblox
 - Edit the code to your liking. The current cheat is set to Phantom Forces, change it if you feel like it.
 - Run <b>find_object_offsets()<b> in https://www.roblox.com/games/5332389196/Hack-Tests to update the offsets in the code.

## Usage (Terminal)
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=(path to libESP.dylib) (path to RobloxPlayer) <br> <br>
[See <b>robloxShell</b> for how I did it]
